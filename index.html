      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="bio" >Thank you for visiting my website! I am a Computer Science Student at SRM University who is currently in 3rd Year. I am interested in Web Development as well as Software Engineering. I also have interest in Mobile App Development and have made some small apps. I've recently started to learn a lot about Machine Learning and plan on creating projects that utilize it.</p>

        <h3>Flutter App Development</h3>
        <p>I have used the <strong>Flutter Framework with Dart</strong> to create Mobile apps that can be deployed on both iOS and Android using a <strong>single codebase</strong>. Some of the apps I've created include a simple <strong>Weather app, BMI Calculator,</strong> and an elementary version of a <strong>Chat App using FireBase</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>I have very recently taken a look at this field of Computer Science and I'm very interested. Since I've just started learning I do not have any projects relating to it. But I <strong>plan on creating some projects</strong> as I learn along the way.</p>

        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>I'm <strong><em>always</em></strong> willing to learn something new. If its something I'm interested in, I'm bound to absorb it quick. And I try my hardest to retain all that information by trying to <strong>build new projects</strong> that incorporate them.</p>
